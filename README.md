# CNC_simulations
Computational Neuroscience projects

These are different simulations based on the content imparted in the online course offered in Coursera by the University of Washington, the simulations 1-5 were based on the proposed by Christoph Bossens  
- [Computational Neuroscience Course](https://es.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience)  
- [Christophe Bossens GH](https://es.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience)  
In the simulation of week 5, the FiFitzhugh-Nagumo model was implemented in [Guilhem Doulcier's website](https://www.normalesup.org/~doulcier/teaching/modeling/excitable_systems.html)

Content:
- Week 2: Simulation of Spiking and Firing Rates
- Week 3: Simulation of Spiking given different inputs, threshold and precision calculation
- Week 4: Simulation of the Enthropy of different neurons
- Week 5: Simulation of different neural models(Integrate-and-fire and Fitzhugh-Nagumo models)
- Week 6_1: Simulation of simple connection between neurons
- Week 6_2: Simulation of simple neural network and detection edges in images filtering through the network
- Week 7&8: Will be linked w/ Deep Learning Course projects

The important files to reed are the ones in /Projects, were you will find the jupyter(.ipynb) files and the converted pdfs
